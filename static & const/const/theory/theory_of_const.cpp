    It is a const variable used to define the variable values that never be changed during the execution of a program.
    And if we try to modify the value, it throws an error.

/*
    Constant is something that doesn't change. In C language and C++ we use the keyword const to make program
    elements constant.

    There are a certain set of rules for the declaration and initialization of the constant variables:
    1.The const variable cannot be left un-initialized at the time of the assignment.
    2.It cannot be assigned value anywhere in the program.
    3.Explicit value needed to be provided to the constant variable at the time of declaration of the
    constant variable.

/*
    Use const keywords with different parameters:

    1.Use const variable
    2.Use const with pointers
    3.Use const pointer with variables
    4.Use const with function arguments
    5.Use const with class member functions
    6.Use const with class data members
    7.Use const with class objects

    What is a symbolic constant?
    A symbolic constant is a name that is given to a constant value. Constant variables are one type of symbolic
    constant, as a variable has a name (its identifier) and a constant value.

    for example:
        # define PI 3.14
*/
int main()
{
}
